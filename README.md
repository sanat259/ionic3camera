Camera module - ionic3

This is a modification of Exsisting Ionic Camera Application Plugin.
The traditional Camera App plugin can only capture a SINGLE picture at a time and returns back.
Even the media capture plugin is sluggish with performance. It requires BASE64 compression that degrades the performance. You need to specify beforehand 
the number of images you want to take.

I have tweaked the Camera App plugin to solve that problem. It supports URI based storage, is responsive and smooth , and comes along with its own 
Image gallery , where you can delete the images.
